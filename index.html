        <p class="lead mb-4">	I am Jason Biet, currently attending University of California Riverside. I am majoring in Pre-Business and concentration is Accounting. I am only a first-year student, but I have a lot of experience with the environment and teachers at the University.  I have a few job and volunteering experience that allows to me to understand the job environment. College has allowed to pursue my dreams on majoring in accounting with the resources and knowledge from other students and professors.  College has been quite an experience my first year where I have been dorming in the Pentland Hills area. It is quite a different experience than living at home, although after my first year I plan on living off campus. This experience cut short because of the COVID-19 outbreak. I could not fully utilize my time at the Student Rec. Center and the dining halls. Although the first two quarters was enough to provide me enough knowledge of the environment on campus. I have also been lucky enough to join some clubs to network with others. I plan on being more connected and interact with more people through my years here in Riverside. Classes at college has been quite a hassle from time to time because of time management and the quarterly system. I believe this is a good thing for me because I can test my abilities to adapt to a new system and test what I can do with some change.  The transition from high school to college has been quite smooth due to the people that I have met in high school. <br><br>

        	Some of my hobbies is playing games, watching sports, listening to music, and exercising. Many of these hobbies is to relieve some stress I am feeling and allows to me to focus on other things that might keep my mind straight. Video games offers a new environment to me where there are plenty of genres to play that will make me happy. Watching sports is like video games where I can watch football, basketball, or baseball to keep me distracted from my work. Video games and sports get me excited about what will happen next, there is a tension that occurs when I am doing it. It is the surprise factor that gets me hooked and interested. Listening to music and exercising are the final ways to relieve my stress. It calms my body down and clears my head. Listening to music allows me to focus on what I am doing and zone into the melody of the song. Exercise improves my confidence and build pup strength for my body. I usually do this almost every day to build up confidence and sustain the health of my body. I tend to play a lot of video games so balancing that out with some exercise help a lot. <br><br>

        	My goals for the future are to finish college and get my MBA. Some short-term goals is to find another job to support the family and myself.  After this COVID-19 pandemic there will be a lot of people looking for jobs so there will be a lot of competition to find jobs. Although there will also be a lot of jobs available for me to find. Another short-term job is getting an internship from an accounting firm to gain some experience and connections with other accounting firms. I believe that building connections is important when I am in college. I want to have plenty of job offers to choose from before and after I graduate. I need to fill out my resume with plenty of job experiences. While also fulfilling my grades. I want to learn some hobbies to learn new skills, stuff like playing a new instrument or learning a new language will be beneficially to my future.
